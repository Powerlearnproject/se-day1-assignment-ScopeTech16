#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Definition
Software Engineering is the systematic process of applying tools,methods and principles of Engineering to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of Software Products.

Importance
Software Engineering is of paramount importance in the technology industry as it automates various aspects of modern life. For instance When we take a look at banking system some decades back. People have to queue at banks to withdraw, transfer and perform other banking activities. But now, we can now perform majority of our banking activities at the comfort of our homes all thanks to Softwares. This also applies to a lot of fields like E-Commerce, Education, Communication, etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) Development of Programming Language(Fortran, C): FORTRAN was developed at IBM by a team led by John Buckus in 1954. It was the first high-level language to have a functional implementation. It is widely knowm for high-performance computing. C  was developed a Bells Lab by Dennis Ritche and Ken Thompson between 1969 and 1973.
2) Introduction of Agile Technology: Agile Technology is a project management framework that breaks projects down into several dynamic phases called sprints. This method of ensures that there is continuous updates on the software even afer deployment.
3) Introduction of Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence as the name Implies is a technology that enables computers to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making etc. Theh act independently replacing the need for human intervention

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Requirement
2) Design
3) Implementation
4) Testing
5) Deployment
6) Maintenance

Requirement: This is the stage where the User requirements are gathered and documented
Design: This is the stage where the Software Architecture and user interface are created by Software Architects and UI/UX designers
Implementation: In this stage, the developers start writing the code and build the software in line with the design specifications
Testing: This is the stage where the Quality Assurance Engineers put several testing plans in place to ensure that the Software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: This is the stage where the Software is released to the Users of Customers
Maintenance: In this stage, improvement is made to the Software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Method is a step-by-step approach to Software development that focuses on sequentially advancing through each stage of the Software Development Life Cycle
WHILE
Agile method is a way of managing projects that focuses on delivering quick results, being able to handle changing requirements and emphasizing teamwork. It encourages an iterative approach, with frequent reviews and adjustments, so that the end product meets the customerâ€™s needs.

Example Of Scenario for Waterfall: 
Example Of Scenario for Waterfall: Software Engineering

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: A Software developer is responsible for writing codes and building the software according to the design specifications
Quality Assurance Engineer: A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for coming up with testing plans to ensure that the Software meets up with quality standards and functional requirements
Project Manager: A project manager is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of the project from start to finish.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments(IDE): These are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes e.g Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc
Version Control Systems(VSC): These are also Software tools for tracking changes to Softwares and also for coordinating work among team members e.g Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
   Solution: Effective Communication and Agile Methodologies
2)  Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
   Solution: Prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1) Unit Testing: This is the process of testing a component of the Software
2) Integration Testing: This is the process of testing more than one component of the Software
3) System Testing: This is the process of testing the entire Software as a whole
4) Acceptance Testing: This is the process of testing the software against user requirements to make sure that it fulfils the user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering can be defined as the process of crafting questions or statements in order to get optimal reponse from AI. It is important in interracting with AI models as it helps with generating the best answers.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Generate a code to get the factorial of a number"

Improved Prompt: "Generate a python code to get the factorial of a number using Recusive Functions"

The improved prompt is more effective as it generates the result based on the programming language of my choice and also the programming method i desire.
